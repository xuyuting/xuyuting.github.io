<h3>Selected Research Projects:</h3>

<h4>Deep Neural Networks for Predicting Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships in Drug Discovery</h4>
	<p>Implemented multi-task deep neural nets (DNN), which predict activities of compounds from multiple assays simultaneously. 
	Developed a novel multi-task DNN approach that automatically build assistant data sets from candidate companion data sets, which efficiently borrows informative knowledge across multiple data sets and boost the prediction accuracy. </p>

<h4>Dynamic Connectivity Detection Algorithm for Change-Point Detection in Brain Imaging Time Series</h4>
	<p>Developed a data-driven change points detection algorithm for partitioning the fMRI time course into distinct temporal intervals, 
	each with different functional connectivity patterns between nodes. Proposed a novel sparse covariance matrix estimation method and significantly 
	speed up the program compared to alternative algorithms, such as the dynamic connectivity regression technique. </p>
	
<h4>Multilevel Binary Principal Component Analysis with Application to High-Dimensional Data</h4>
	<p>Developed a multilevel probabilistic PCA model to analyze high-dimensional binary data with replicate measurements. 
	Proposed a nested variational EM approach for model fitting, which is computationally efficient and scalable for large data sets. </p>
	
<h4>Developing N-leaping Algorithm for Accelerating Stochastic Simulation of Coupled Chemical Reactions</h4>
	<p>Developed a novel approximate stochastic simulation algorithm 'N-leaping', which shows favorable high efficiency and accuracy compared to the most 
	popular approximate algorithms, such as the tau-leaping method. </p>
